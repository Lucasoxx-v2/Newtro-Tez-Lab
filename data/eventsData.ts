## BUILDING CULTURE FROM THE ROOTS OF LATAM
    
We are writing these words on Tuesday 4th of February 2025. Exactly 11 days before the joint exhibition of Newtro (Argentina) and SEED (Brazil) collectives of onchain artists, happening February 15th.

The exhibition (which will open to artists from both collectives, friends and family) will feature works from artists of both communities, followed by a day filled with panels and discussions among our collectives. Our ultimate goal? To distill these conversations into a Manifesto, something that captures our shared visions and ambitions. And, of course, there will be onchain activations, including this, our first-ever Objkt Gallery collection—a milestone for Newtro, and a very special opportunity to celebrate and create alongside our friends and colleagues from S.E.E.D. <3

So, as you can see, these are busy and exciting days! Although, occasionally clouded by minor preoccupations, common to the production of any event event. One that flits through our collective mind right now is the challenge of communication: after all, we’re in Argentina speaking Spanish, while our partners in Brazil speak Portuguese. How can we bridge this linguistic divide? A minor worry, perhaps, but it’s been casting a tiny shadow on an otherwise sunny outlook.

So as we prepare to welcome SEED and while pondering these communication challenges, we keep thinking about the power of words. And one image keeps returning to our collective mind’s eye... the image of a spider’s web.

You know, a spider’s web is more than just a tool for survival—it’s a finely-tuned, living sensor. It's sensitive, fragile yet resilient connecting every thread with purpose. It is a powerful thing! For example once, a spider’s web saved a prophet who was hiding in a cave from its persecutors who could not stand this prophet's message.

“This cave is blocked by a spider web! Probably no one has entered here in a long time.”

Little did they know, the web had been spun in just one night to protect something precious.

When needed, DO work fast for something worthwhile.

The blockchain, too, feels like a web—a tool of great opportunity for artists, but also a fragile thing. The opportunities this technology has given to artists  may not last forever. It is something worth protecting.

We—SEED and Newtro—are building something more than just a casual digital space to entertain ourselves. A web is delicate, easily formed by simple connections, but it’s in the whole network that true strength lies. In this network, we do not just exist beside each other, linked by a thread or two of shared interests. Instead, we create bonds that are sensitive, alive, and responsive to the movements of one another. Our connections go beyond the virtual; they are grounded in our local realities—Newtro in Argentina, SEED in Brazil—while stretching out across the digital realms of the blockchain. And just as a spider can feel the faintest tremor in its web, our communities are always reading the cultural onchain landscape developing in front of our multiple eyes... And we feel the urge to always help grow something precious.

A lot can be said about the complexities present today for onchain artists, but we don’t think this article would be the correct place for it. I hope we can, collectively, come to some conclusions about it on this IRL gathering of artists collectives from Latin America. On the meantime, and for the sake of context and achieve a better understanding among each other, you, dear anon, can read this brief document regarding our general approach to onchain art and its potential:

VISION FOR ONCHAIN ARTS AND CULTURE
https://docs.google.com/document/d/13l5-SuqITTAXWIknvggu7OTVpyO_nXAaO8T33e-Grpg/view

Challenges ahead aside, some of the good and promises of this ecosystem seem to be, still, hopefully evergreen. Platforms like Objkt, to whom we are deeply grateful for their constant support to the community of artists through their work and for playing “the long game”, always championing onchain artists,is a great example of it. We have to also thank the S.E.E.D. collective of artists, who fills the onchain ecosystem with their awesome energy and creations, and also serves as a mirror to reflect ourselves in our efforts to be positive agents of change as a collective. We hope for many more collectives of artists in the future, and for tighter bonds among each one of them. If we can be of any assistance in a mission, you are only just one message away of finding a helping hand <3

Finally, an invitation! You can check right now our very first Gallery collection, an open call to artists from both communities, with the objective to help us fund the upcoming events <3. Hope you find it eye catching, and that you get to discover some awesome artists!!

That’s it for now dear friend.

Remember to keep weaving and dreaming.

And you know... the spider patiently waits for the fly to come <3

Talk to you soon!

With love,

Newtro & S.E.E.D.

## LATAM CULTURE BUILDERS

En la era de la hiperconexión y la emergente web descentralizada, los artistas y gestores culturales latinoamericanos habitan un ecosistema digital que desafía y redefine las nociones de identidad y soberanía cultural. Sus prácticas artísticas en la web3 son actos de resistencia y emancipación, construyendo puentes en un mercado global que a menudo homogeneiza y reduce a los creadores a la pasiva figura de usuarios tecnológicos.
Frente a desafíos económicos y disparidades estructurales, la blockchain se presenta como una herramienta de visibilización y profesionalización, desarrollando nuevas formas de acceso y circulación a nuestra cultura viva y autogestiva. A través del trabajo en red y el apoyo comunitario, estas prácticas emergen como un faro de diversidad y autenticidad cultural, demostrando que en la intersección de la tecnología y la cultura, estas identidades soberanas no solo se preservan, sino que florecen y reconfiguran nuestra manera de relacionarnos con el mundo real.
Esta exhibición, curada por Newtro, pone en diálogo la figura del BUILDER en internet, expandiendo su significado a un espacio en donde, artistas y gestores culturales, pueden reflexionar sobre su impacto en la cultura web3 emergente y cómo esto aporta una mirada distinta sobre el uso de la tecnología en pos del desarrollo de identidades y expresiones culturales más soberanas.
Adoptar nuevas tecnologías es parte de un diálogo colectivo global, en el cual las voces se atomizan en tanto sea posible el desarrollo de identidades más soberanas; produciendo así un impacto orgánico en el territorio local IRL, que es proporcional a las posibilidades que presente el ecosistema digital web3 con sus herramientas descentralizadas (dApps).
Tokenizar arte, formar comunidad, colaborar entre colegas, comunicar y enseñar, incorporar tecnologías emergentes y representar la práctica web3 en la cultura del mundo real, son varios de los nodos que dan vida a esta red descentralizada de gestorxs culturales, artistas y comunicadorxs que hoy aportan su legado a la adopción de la tecnología blockchain desde Latinoamérica hacia todo el mundo.

## Correlated States 

This event was an unforgettable celebration that took place on Saturday, April 27, 2024, at DVNE PARK in Buenos Aires. This event brought together over 100 artists from Argentina's web3 cultural ecosystem. The main exhibition, curated by Jotta.rs, Lucasoxx, and Sky Goodman, showcased the works of over 15 native web3 artists in an immersive installation crafted by a talented team of 15 local artists. It was a mixture of screens, prints, lasers, and obsolete technologies in an ecosystem full of art,
Newtro played a key role by supporting the production and presenting their metaverse galleries (built by @eltito_art collaborating with 3D artists) with artworks from drops made over 2023. They also hosted a welcoming dinner for more than 50 artists, many of whom met in person for the first time.
The night didn't end there. The event closed with an after-party featuring music live sets from Gönz and Sulkian, capping off a surreal evening that lasted until the early morning hours. This event wasn't just a celebration of art—it was a convergence of Argentina's web3 art scene, filled with creativity, connection, and the shared experience of living together in a house in the heart of Buenos Aires, welcoming artists from across the country and even special guests from Brazil.
This exhibition aimed to showcase the incredible artistic talent spread across Argentina, many of whom had never met in person but had formed an active community since mid-2021 with Hic Et Nunc, an experimental digital art marketplace on the Tezos blockchain. The interaction with screens within a natural machine-like ecosystem expanded feedback beyond its limits, where the (im)materiality of digital art became omnipresent through nature and technology. Each space within this exhibition revealed echoes and dialogues about identity, artistic processes, and culture, all moving together to form a whole that could not be measured by the sum of its parts.

## Curatorial concept

“In quantum physics, the concept of "correlated states" refers to the entanglement between two or more quantum systems. When particles, like electrons or photons, become entangled, the properties of one particle are linked or correlated with those of another, regardless of the distance between them.
Artists working online and across borders form similar entanglements, much like particles in quantum mechanics. Their interconnected creative productions shape a community that defies geographical limitations. In this digital realm, the work of one artist is closely correlated with others, contributing to and becoming part of the collective consciousness.
The inherent desire for personal connection and deeper exchange of inspiration gave rise to this art exhibition, where artists from Argentina and Latin America participated in a celebration in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This event served as a physical manifestation of the correlated states experienced by artists collaborating in web3.”

## Chronicle of Residencia Bosque Gracias Summer 2024

### Day 1
Like a gathering no one wanted to miss or arrive late to, the days before the residency were filled with preparation, giving us enough time to settle in and tune ourselves to the pace and gestures the forest would suggest. The purpose was clear from the beginning: to meet each other, to share our artistic practices, and above all, to inhabit a powerful natural environment, co-creating with nature and in community.

One of our first activities was to explore the forest trails. Each step revealed unexpected colors, shapes, textures, and patterns. Very quickly, walking these paths became a ritual, capable of sparking new ideas and even entire works of art.

Observing and co-creating with nature in 2024 also meant working with cameras, GPS, phones for photogrammetry, scanners, and other digital tools. These became our allies for capturing the vivid essence of the forest and experimenting as digital artists.

Many of us had arrived from busy cities, where daily noise and speed often steal the ability to simply be present. Breathing deeply, connecting with our bodies and minds, grounding ourselves in the forest’s rhythms—this became a shared commitment.

A guided meditation in the morning opened the residency perfectly. It gave space for impressions, intentions, gratitude, laughter, and reflection on the invitation Bosque Gracias was extending to us: to co-create throughout the week.

The first workshop came in the afternoon, led by our host, Rocío Mio (@handle), who generously shared her process of crafting and working with natural inks made from the fruits of the forest. Seeing their unconventional colors and behaviors was already inspiring, but even more so was watching Ignacio Ysidro (@handle), an experienced watercolor painter, encountering these inks for the very first time, experimenting live, and revealing new expressive possibilities.

### Day 2
The “Casa Madre,” the central house of Bosque Gracias and the only spot with Wi-Fi, quickly became our creative hub. It was easy to step outside to disconnect, and just as easy to re-enter and find the energy of fellow artists working, talking, and sharing mate.

Early in the day, we enjoyed a special presentation from Ber Sektor, pixel artist and co-creator of Shitty Games, an indie game studio with more than a decade of crafting titles rooted in Argentine culture. He introduced us to pixel art techniques and tools, inviting us to experiment and even create small animations.

Later, the residency also became a place for printmaking. With a simple laser printer, artists like Gonz and Santiago Ruau created black-and-white posters and left their mark on the residency house, joining an ongoing collaborative collage that already included works from friends like Takashoshi, Juanito, and Pamilo Ceirone.

In the afternoon, we welcomed artists and neighbors from Epuyén for an introductory talk on art and Web3. Our project was born online, so meeting in person carried twice the value. The session was a chance to share perspectives and encourage critical thought, seeing blockchain not only as a technological tool but also as a social phenomenon. Artists digitized ceramic pieces, scanned drawings, and brainstormed strategies for entering digital markets. Spontaneous collaborations began to emerge—bridges between the local community and our residency practice.

### Day 3
One of the most anticipated workshops arrived: cyanotype printing, guided by Rocío Mio. This sun-based photographic process, known for its low toxicity and ecological qualities, proved to be a perfect fit for our setting. We experimented with found objects—plants, seeds, toys, lamps, even bones—placing them on photosensitive paper to create unique blue-toned images.

The results transformed the Casa Madre into a sea of deep blue sheets. The process was magical, offering us endless creative possibilities and filling us with awe. Cyanotypes not only expanded our artistic vocabulary but also deepened our connection with the rhythms of light and matter in the forest.

### Day 4
By the fourth day, synergy among residents was undeniable. Spontaneous collaborations were already taking shape, alongside works in progress inspired directly by our experiences. Afternoons were spent swimming in the river, while evenings brought new explorations—like embroidery, introduced as an extension of pixel art by Ber Sektor.

That night, we held a collaborative audio-visual jam. With projectors, speakers, MIDI controllers, microphones, synths, and percussion instruments, we created an organic ritual of sound and image. Techniques of mapping and VJing blended seamlessly with improvised music, producing a collective dialogue that felt both sacred and playful.

### Day 5
By now, the commitment to experimentation was unquestionable. The Residencia Bosque Gracias x Newtro collection already had dozens of published works, and the creative rhythm flowed naturally between time spent in the forest and time spent producing.

In the evening, Lucasoxx brought a reading that opened discussion on how social media and digital platforms assign value to multimedia artworks, and on the (im)materiality of digital art on the internet. Is an artwork nothing more than a blockchain record and a hosted file, infinitely replicable and remixable? Or is it transformed into something shared, collective, and worldly? The conversation did not aim for answers but for more questions—fuel for critical thought in Web3 practice.

The night ended with a video art session: analog cameras, processors, CRT televisions, MIDI controllers, and feedback loops became instruments for glitch art. Works emerged spontaneously, re-signifying material created earlier in the week through new techniques.

### Day 6
With summer nearly over, time in the sun and river was precious. Walks through the forest, picking berries and apples, reminded us of the gifts surrounding us.

Back at Casa Madre, the atmosphere resembled a creative cybercafé. Computers filled every table, and on one special evening, everyone connected to Hydra, an online platform for live-coded visuals. Guided by Jotta and Zoen, we learned the basics of coding generative visuals in real time. For many, it was the very first time programming—and the excitement was palpable.

### Day 7
Together with Santiago Ruau, we visited the lake for an open drawing session. Santiago encouraged us to loosen our strokes, to create at least five freehand sketches, and to embrace joy in the act of drawing. Each participant found their rhythm, turning the exercise into a playful and liberating practice.

Later, we deepened our collaborative works and ventured into textiles, exploring masks, makeup, and character creation with the forest as backdrop. This workshop invited us into narrative and performance, weaving imagination into the natural environment while strengthening the connections between us as creators.

### Final Day
The residency culminated in an unforgettable night: a live multimedia performance and exhibition in the forest. Screens, CRTs, projectors, feedback systems, generative music, instruments, and the urgency of the final jam merged into one collective installation.

Residencia Bosque Gracias came to an end, but it left us already dreaming and planning for the next encounter.
